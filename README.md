# MyWebXRM
This project has sample of automation framework and tests that i have written over past few years. 
Intention of this repository is to provide an idea of architecture of an automated testing solution.

Framework - This folder has the extesions, helpers and other folders for implementing common functionality that is used by all tests

WebXRMPages and WebXRMTests - I have used the Page Object Model (POM) pattern in this automation solution. These folders contains the pages 
and the tests respectively. The tests use Selenium and C#.

MobileAutomation - This automates the mobile version of the product. I have used Appium , UI Automator for this.This project also follows 
the Page Object Model.Screens folder has code for mobile pages and Tests folder have the code for tests.
